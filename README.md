# OpenDRR Documentation

This repository contains documentation on high-level requirements for the OpenDRR platform.

NOTE: To view the models in the models/ directory, you will need to install
[Archi â€“ the open-source modelling toolkit for creating ArchiMate models and sketches](https://www.archimatetool.com/).

Archi can be downloaded from https://www.archimatetool.com/

## GitHub Pages

Some of the documentation are served at the https://opendrr.github.io/documentation/ website, especially:

- [A Federated OpenDRR Platform to Support Disaster Resilience Planning in Canada: High Level Requirements](https://opendrr.github.io/documentation/docs/opendrr-platform.html)

It is rendered from AsciiDoc with Jekyll using the [GCWeb, the WET-BOEW Canada.ca theme](https://wet-boew.github.io/GCWeb/index-en.html).  The website source lives in the [gh-pages-source](https://github.com/OpenDRR/documentation/tree/gh-pages-source) and is deployed to the [gh-pages](https://github.com/OpenDRR/documentation/tree/gh-pages) branch.
